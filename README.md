# Journal Article Cataloguing System

##### A cataloguing system specifcally designed for organizing scientific writing. Think Goodreads, but for researchers.


### Introduction

**What will the application do?**
 
Scientists read thousands of papers over the course of their career. As a result, it can be hard to organize the papers that you have previously read (or are planning on reading). The idea for this application is a simple cataloguing system for scientific writing. There exist many reference managers like Mendeley whose purpose is to keep a record of papers you are using/reading for your research. However, these services are often paid, and usually only contain basic functionality for organizing papers by topic (e.g. manually placing papers in folders/subfolders, thus only allowing "one category") which are not as helpful to researchers for keeping track of the papers they read and how they all relate to each other. This can make it harder to find that "one paper" with the obscure technique you read about years ago.

Thus, the primary goal of this project is to design a free application for users to store records of the different articles they have/plan to read, and organize them by category, etc. 

If time and skill permits, I would ideally like to implement a more complex structure for assigning category hierarchies between topics, as well as maybe implement some interesting summaries and visualizations to get an overview of the papers you have read (e.g. what percentage of the papers have you read fall into each category? How have your reading topics changed over time?), as well as to allow exporting of this data to make it easier  share your catalogue of papers to recommend to others.

**Who will use it?**

Potential users include university students, research scientists, or anyone who consumes a lot of scientific writing and seeks a way to organize their readings.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

Coming from a previous life science background, I have spent *a lot of time* searching through folders of papers I've stored to find a certain paper I read about. And I have often wondered about what a summary of the papers I read would look like. These all centered around the idea of creating an application centered around organizing papers by topic, which is how this idea came to mind.
